IronHack canvas game project


INTRODUCTION

“Solongo!” is the name of my first game project made entirely with Canvas and javascript. “Solongo!” is a completely functional, in-colour version, true to the feel of the original of the game. My game has a lot of potential for growth in various directions but I am proud of getting the functionality of the game right. For me, it is a huge step forward because it was only three weeks ago that I started attending the Iron Hack full stack developer bootcamp, and creating a game in Canvas was our first official class project after the first two weeks of the bootcamp. 

INSTRUCTIONS

The game starts on window load. The snake head (yellow square)  and the food (white square) will both appear on the grid in random coordinates. The food will appear in a new position once the food which was already placed on the grid is eaten. 

The snake head has a constant speed which is transformed every time a piece of food is eaten; it will also begin the game in a random direction. Which means you could appear right next to a grid wall and run right into it! It’s ok, that’s part of the game! Just hit OK on the game over alert window and start over!

MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE

Marrying a game into a second canvas on the screen. Several things happening at once can really jumble up the code, especially when you try to marry two different projects (the canvas, and the game) together. 

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS

Make it look better! The score and animation and sound can definitely be fleshed out to make the game more interactive and appealing. A multiplayer experience is totally plausible, and different difficulty levels would make the game even more engaging. An intro window with a top players score board, an input for a player’s name; a start button to begin the game, a pause feature and a fleshed out game over window instead of an alert.

I FEEL PROUD

I set a goal I knew I could strive for. I’m not much of a gamer, but Snake I understand. I’ve known how it works since I first my first times playing it on my old Nokia phone, and I could start to think about how to recreate it for my class project. I also enjoyed creating the canvas and colouring the game, which came out nicely. I’m proud of that as well. Decorating the canvas’ was fun and challenging especially since I had two canvas’ running at the same time, with different backgrounds, the smaller one superimposed over the larger one, with the game running on top of the upper background, which decorates the actual game grid.

The collisions are also recreated to a tea. Aligning the collisions between the snake and its food, the grid walls, or its own tail was a challenging feat and am proud to have laid the entire groundwork, and with a little help from my teacher, Dani, who helped me figure the kinks out, made it work in the end.

IF I STARTED IT ALL OVER AGAIN

I wouldn’t worry about making a game screen responsive (which took me a while longer than I thought it would) when I should be focused on making a game!
